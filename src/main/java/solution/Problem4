Consider the following array: 1, 0, 13, 50, 22, 14
If this is the result after the first partition of quicksort,
which of these elements could have been the pivot?

Solution:
13.
Explanation was not required for this question, but here it is:
Because after partitioning the array, elements on the left side of the pivot should be less than the pivot,
and elements on the right side of the pivot should be greater or equal to the pivot.
This is true only for element 13.
On the left hand side, 1 and 0 are less than 13. On the right side of 13,
50, 22, 14 are all larger than 13.
